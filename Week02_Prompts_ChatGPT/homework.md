# Week 02: Voluntary Assignment

## Assignment: Mastering Prompt Engineering

### Part 1: Prompt Design Challenge

**Task:** Create optimized prompts for three different use cases:

1. **Creative Writing Assistant**
   - Design prompts for story generation
   - Include character development and plot structure
   - Test with different genres

2. **Technical Documentation Generator**
   - Create prompts for API documentation
   - Include code examples and explanations
   - Focus on clarity and completeness

3. **Data Analysis Helper**
   - Develop prompts for interpreting datasets
   - Include statistical analysis requests
   - Test with sample data

**Deliverables:**
- Document all prompts tested (minimum 3 per use case)
- Include ChatGPT responses for each prompt
- Provide analysis of which prompts worked best and why

### Part 2: Prompt Optimization Study
**Choose one specific task and optimize it through iteration**

1. **Baseline Prompt**
   - Start with a simple, direct prompt
   - Document the initial response quality

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Create 5 different versions of the prompt
   - Apply different techniques: few-shot examples, chain-of-thought, role-playing
   - Measure and compare response quality

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accuracy of information
- Completeness of response
- Clarity and readability
- Relevance to the request

### Part 3: Prompt Engineering Best Practices
**Create a personal prompt engineering guide**

Write a 400-600 word guide including:
1. Top 5 techniques that worked best for you
2. Common mistakes to avoid
3. Specific examples from your experiments
4. Tips for different types of tasks

## Resources
- OpenAI Playground for testing
- Course prompt library
- Peer review sessions (optional)
- Office hours for guidance

## Tips for Success
1. Test prompts multiple times for consistency
2. Keep detailed notes on what works
3. Don't be afraid to experiment with unusual approaches
4. Focus on clarity and specificity in your prompts
