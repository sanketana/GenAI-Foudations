## Step 2: Define System Prompt

### What is a System Prompt?

A system prompt is the foundational instruction that defines an AI model's role, behavior, and capabilities before any user interaction begins. It acts as the "personality" and "job description" for the AI, setting the context and boundaries for all subsequent conversations.



### Why System Prompts Are Critical

**1. Behavior Control:** System prompts establish the AI's personality, tone, and response style

**2. Context Setting:** They provide background information and domain expertise

**3. Safety & Ethics:** They define boundaries and prevent harmful or inappropriate responses

**4. Consistency:** They ensure uniform behavior across all user interactions

**5. Specialization:** They transform a general-purpose AI into a domain-specific expert

### Real-World System Prompt Examples

## Step 3: Crafting Effective User Prompts

### Understanding User Prompts

User prompts are the specific instructions, questions, or requests that users send to AI models. While system prompts define the AI's role and behavior, user prompts determine what specific task or information the AI should provide.

### Key Principles of Effective User Prompts

#### 1. **Clarity and Specificity**
‚ùå **Poor:** "Tell me about AI"
‚úÖ **Good:** "Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning, with 3 practical examples of each"

#### 2. **Context and Background**
‚ùå **Poor:** "Write code for a website"
‚úÖ **Good:** "I'm building a portfolio website for a graphic designer. I need a responsive HTML/CSS layout with a hero section, about me, portfolio gallery, and contact form. The design should be modern and minimalist."

#### 3. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
‚ùå **Poor:** "Analyze this data"
‚úÖ **Good:** "Please analyze this sales data by: 1) Calculating monthly revenue trends, 2) Identifying top-performing products, 3) Suggesting 3 actionable insights for improvement"

#### 4. **Output Format Specification**
‚ùå **Poor:** "List programming languages"
‚úÖ **Good:** "List 10 popular programming languages in a table format with columns for: Language Name, Primary Use Case, Difficulty Level, and Job Market Demand"

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### Zero-Shot Prompting
Asking the AI to perform a task without providing examples.

**Example:**
```
Classify this text as positive, negative, or neutral: "The new software update significantly improved system performance."
```

#### Few-Shot Prompting
Providing examples to guide the AI's response format and style.

**Example:**
```
Text: "I love this product!"
Sentiment: Positive

Text: "This is terrible quality."
Sentiment: Negative

Text: "The new software update significantly improved system performance."
Sentiment: Positive
```

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encouraging the AI to show its reasoning process step by step.

**Example:**
```
Let's solve this step by step:

Problem: A restaurant has 20 tables. Each table can seat 4 people. 
The restaurant is open for 6 hours and each table is occupied for 2 hours on average.
How many customers can the restaurant serve in a day?

Let me think through this:
1) First, I need to understand the capacity
2) Then, I'll calculate how many times each table can be used
3) Finally, I'll determine the total number of customers

Solution:
```

#### Role-Based Prompting
Assigning a specific role or expertise to the AI.

**Example:**
```
You are a senior data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning.
You specialize in time series forecasting and have worked with companies like Google and Amazon.
Please explain how to implement a sales forecasting model using Python.
```
