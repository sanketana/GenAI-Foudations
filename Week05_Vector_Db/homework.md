# Week 05: Voluntary Assignment

## Assignment: Vector Database Implementation

### Part 1: Database Comparison Study

**Task:** Compare three different vector database solutions

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Set up Pinecone, ChromaDB, and FAISS
   - Load the same dataset into each system
   - Document setup process and challenges

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Benchmark query speed and accuracy
   - Test with different dataset sizes
   - Measure memory and storage requirements
   - Compare API usability and features

### Part 2: Production Vector Search System
**Build a scalable semantic search application**

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Process and embed large document collection
   - Implement batch processing for efficiency
   - Handle duplicate detection and updates
   - Add metadata management

2. **Search Implementation**
   - Build efficient similarity search
   - Add filtering and faceted search
   - Implement pagination and result ranking
   - Optimize query performance

3. **API Development**
   - Create REST API for search operations
   - Add authentication and rate limiting
   - Include comprehensive error handling
   - Document API endpoints

### Part 3: Advanced Features
**Implement production-ready enhancements**

Choose two of the following:
1. **Multi-modal Search**
   - Support text and image embeddings
   - Cross-modal similarity search
   - Unified ranking system

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Live index updates
   - Change detection and synchronization
   - Minimal downtime deployment

3. **Hybrid Search**
