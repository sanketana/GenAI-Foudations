# Week 06: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Part 1 - Instructor Notes

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding RAG architecture and concepts
- Implementing basic RAG systems
- Combining retrieval with language models
- Evaluating RAG system performance

## Key Topics to Cover
1. RAG fundamentals and motivation
2. System architecture and components
3. Retrieval strategies and optimization
4. Integration with language models
5. Context management and prompt construction

## Hands-on Activities
- Building a simple RAG pipeline
- Document indexing and retrieval
- Prompt engineering for RAG
- Testing with different document types
- Performance evaluation and debugging

## Critical Concepts
- Information retrieval vs generation
- Context window limitations
- Relevance vs accuracy trade-offs
- Retrieval quality impact on generation
- Handling conflicting information

## Common Challenges
- Poor retrieval quality
- Context length limitations
- Hallucination despite retrieval
- Slow response times
- Relevance ranking issues

## Evaluation Metrics
- Retrieval accuracy and recall
- Generation quality and factualness
- Response time and efficiency
- User satisfaction measures
- End-to-end system performance
