The class has a homepage where homework assignments and solutions are posted online. There are also detailed lecture notes available on the course homepage. Additionally, there's a newsgroup for class discussions and forming study groups, which is not monitored by the teaching staff. The contact for the teaching staff is an email address that is read by all the TAs and the instructor.\n",
