   - Optimize retrieval and generation pipelines
   - Add async processing for better throughput
   - Minimize latency while maintaining quality

2. **Scalability and Reliability**
   - Deploy using containerization (Docker)
   - Implement health checks and monitoring
   - Add error handling and graceful degradation
   - Support load balancing and auto-scaling

### Part 3: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework
**Build automated evaluation and monitoring systems**

1. **Automated Evaluation Pipeline**
   - Implement RAGAS or similar evaluation framework
   - Create custom metrics for your domain
   - Add ground truth dataset and benchmarking
   - Generate automated evaluation reports

2. **Production Monitoring**
   - Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
   - Monitor user satisfaction and feedback
   - Implement alerting for system issues
   - Create dashboards for system health

## Tips for Success
1. Start with solid Week 06 foundation and iterate
2. Focus on one advanced technique at a time
3. Measure performance impact of each optimization
4. Design for production from the beginning
5. Create comprehensive evaluation before optimization
6. Document design decisions and trade-offs
7. Test with realistic production workloads
