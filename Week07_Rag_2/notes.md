# Week 07: RAG Part 2 - Advanced Techniques - Instructor Notes

## Learning Objectives
- Advanced RAG optimization techniques
- Multi-modal and complex retrieval patterns
- Production deployment and scaling
- RAG system evaluation and monitoring

## Key Topics to Cover
1. Advanced retrieval strategies (hierarchical, multi-hop)
2. Query expansion and reformulation
3. Multi-modal RAG (text, images, structured data)
4. Context compression and summarization
5. Production monitoring and optimization

## Advanced Techniques
- Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)
- Multi-query retrieval and fusion
- Retrieval with metadata filtering
- Re-ranking and relevance scoring
