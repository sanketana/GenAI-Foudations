# Week 08 MCP Code Workspace

This folder holds reference code and exercises for the Model Context Protocol module.

## Structure
- `server/` — Sample MCP server implementation and configuration
- `client/` — Example scripts or notebooks for connecting an LLM client to the server
- `tools/` — Custom tool definitions and helper utilities

Create subfolders as you build out your solutions. The provided homework references should live here.

## Quickstart
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate it and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch the sample server (to be added) and test connectivity using your preferred client.

Document any setup quirks or platform-specific steps directly in this README as you iterate.
