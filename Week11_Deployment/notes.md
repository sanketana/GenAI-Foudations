# Week 11: Deployment - Instructor Notes

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding deployment strategies for AI applications
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for ML projects
- Managing production environments and monitoring
- Scaling applications for real-world usage

## Key Topics to Cover
1. Deployment platforms and options (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)
2. Containerization with Docker and orchestration
3. CI/CD pipelines for AI/ML applications
4. Environment management and configuration
5. Monitoring, logging, and observability

## Hands-on Activities
- Containerizing Streamlit applications with Docker
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Deploying to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Implementing monitoring and alerting systems
- Performance testing and optimization in production

## Deployment Platforms
- Streamlit Cloud (managed hosting)
- Heroku (PaaS deployment)
- AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk)
- Google Cloud Platform (App Engine, Cloud Run)
- Azure (App Service, Container Instances)
- Self-hosted solutions

## Production Considerations
- Security and authentication
- SSL/TLS and HTTPS configuration
- Database and data persistence
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Cost optimization and resource management
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User analytics and usage metrics
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
